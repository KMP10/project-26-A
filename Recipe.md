pour two and half glass of water in container in which you are making your noodles.

then put the noodles in it and finally add the noodle masala.(ohh and don't forget to keep the gas at the max.)

plz wait till the noodles turn orange-yellowish. then just take the noodles in a bowl or plate and eat it. simple.
